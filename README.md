## Multi-Sample CHOPs

*Doing More with Fewer Nodes*

CHOPs are an incredibly powerful family in the TouchDesigner ecosystem, but working with multi-sample CHOPs isn’t always as intuitive as you might hope. This session will look at how we can perform many operations simultaneously in a single CHOP by taking advantage of multi-sample CHOP magic. Everything from converting longitude and latitude to xyz coords, calculating bearing/rotate-to vectors, multi-sample lag and filtering, and more complex transform operations (copy-sop style transforms) - and much much more can be done for all the samples in a multi-sample CHOP.

In this repo, examples cover the following:

- Calculating distance - finding points within a volume can be especially powerful for visualization or logic operations.
- Boolean conversions - we’ll look at how we can convert floats into simple on or off values useful for triggering events.
- Smoothing is an essential operation in TouchDesigner and we can use Speed, Lag, and Filter CHOPs across multiple samples for exciting results.
- Shuffling is an essential helper for working with multiple samples - we’ll use our shuffle skills to arrange and rearrange our data.

## Auto Complete Python in TouchDesigner

***Session Date***        |  November 8th, 2023  
***Repo Directory***     |  `auto-complete-python`   

Working with Python in TouchDesigner can be its own challenge, even more so when you’re unable to take advantage of some of the best features of your code editor. In this session we’ll look at how you can get autocomplete working for your own Python modules in vsCode and how to make that play nice in TouchDesigner. This can help speed up your use of Python, and make it even easier to collaborate with other developers.

In this repo, examples cover the following:

- We’ll start by demystifying how Python imports work. If you’ve ever been confused about how import works in both Python and TouchDesigner, we’ll start by making this part as clear as possible.
- Understanding imports means we can break up our code into smaller reusable pieces, and getting to the bottom of Modules both in and outside of TouchDesigner is an essential skill in deeping your Python prowess.
- Code auto completion takes advantage of what your code editor (in this case vsCode) knows about your code so you can work faster. We’ll look at how just a few changes in your workflow can dramatically improve your ability to work quickly, and with other developers.
